# Ultimate Bravery

[League of Legends](http://na.leagueoflegends.com) idea that allows the user to test their summoner skills by relying less on the items they build. Eventual goal is to make Mobile application.

Created to expand the idea of [GiantFunny.com](http://giantfunny.com/ultimate_bravery.php) by adding images and recreating how they built their application with PHP into JAVASCRIPT.

Application uses JS objects to control the flow of the data. While image sprite keeps request numbers down.
